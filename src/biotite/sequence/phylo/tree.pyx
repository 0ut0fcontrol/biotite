class Tree:
    """
    __init__(root)
    
    A `Tree` represents a rooted binary tree
    (e.g. phylogentic tree).
    The tree itself is represented by `TreeNode` objects.
    The root node is accessible via the `root` property.
    The property `leaves` contains a list of the leaf nodes, where the
    index of the leaf node in this list is equal to the reference index
    of the leaf node (``leaf.index``).

    Objects of this class are immutable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    root: TreeNode
        The root of the tree.
        The constructor calls the node's `as_root()` method,
        in order to make it immutable.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    root : TreeNode
        The root node of the tree.
    leaves : list of TreeNode
        The leaf nodes of the tree.
        The index of the leaf node in this list is equal to the
        reference index of the leaf node.
        This attribute is a shallow copy of the repsective internal
        object.

    Examples
    --------
    
    >>> leaf1 = TreeNode(index=0)
    >>> leaf2 = TreeNode(index=1)
    >>> leaf3 = TreeNode(index=2)
    >>> inter = TreeNode(leaf1, leaf2, 5.0, 7.0)

             index=None)
    
    `TreeNode` objects are part of a rooted binary tree
    (e.g. phylogentic tree).
    There are two `TreeNode` subtypes:
        
        - Leaf node - Cannot have child nodes but has an index referring
          to an array-like reference object.
        - Intermediate node - Has two child nodes but no reference index
    
    This type is determined by the time of the object's creation.
    
    Every `TreeNode` has a reference to its parent node.
    A root node is node without a parent node, that is finalized
    using `as_root()`.
    The call of this function prevents that a the node can be used as
    child.

    `TreeNode` objects are semi-immutable:
    The child nodes or the reference index are fixed at the time of
    creation.
    Only the parent can be set once, when the parent node is created. 
    `TreeNode` objects that are finalized using `as_root()` are
    completely immutable.

    All object properties are read-only.

    Parameters
    ----------
    child1, child2: TreeNode, optional
        The childs of this node.
        As this causes the creation of an intermediate node,
        this parameter cannot be used in combination with `index`.
    child1_distance, child2_distance: float, optional
        The distances of the child nodes to this node.
        Must be set if `child1` and `child2` are set.
    index: int, optional
        Index to a reference array-like object
        (e.g. list of sequences or labels).
        Must be a positive integer.
        As this causes the creation of a leaf node, this parameter
        cannot be used in combination with the other parameters.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    parent : TreeNode
        The parent node.
        `None` if node has no parent.
    childs : tuple(TreeNode, TreeNode)
        The child nodes.
        `None` if node has no child nodes.
    index : int
        The index to a reference array-like object.
        `None` if node is not a leaf node.
    distance : float
        Distance to parent node.
        `None` if `parent` is `Ç¸one`.

    --------
