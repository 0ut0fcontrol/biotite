    Parameters
    ----------
    atom_array : AtomArray
        The nucleic-acid-strand to be represented in DBL-notation.
    scoring : ndarray, dtype=int, shape=(n,) (default: None)

    The nucleic acid strand is represented as continuously counted
    nucleotide sequence, where the nucleotides are counted from zero.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basepairs : ndarray, shape=(n,2)
        Each row corresponds to the positions of the bases in the
        strand.
    length : int
        The number of bases in the strand.
    scoring : ndarray, dtype=int, shape=(n,) (default: None)
        The score for each basepair, which is passed on to
        :func:`pseudoknots()`

    Returns
    -------
    notations : list [str, ...]
        The DBL-notation for each solution from :func:`pseudoknots()`.

    Examples
    --------
    The sequence ``ACGTC`` has a length of 5. If there was to be a
    pairing interaction between the ``A`` and ``T``, ``basepairs`` would
    have the form:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> basepairs = np.array([[0, 3]])

    The DBL Notation can then be found with ``dot_bracket()``:

    >>> dot_bracket(basepairs, 5)[0]
    '(..).'
