def density(atoms, selection=None, delta=1.0, bins=None,
            density=False, weights=None):
    r"""
    Compute the density of an atoms selection.

    This creates a 3d histogram over the coordinates of selected atoms.
    By default, the grid for the histogram is built based on the
    coordinates of the given `atoms` with an even gridspacing of
    `delta` in all three
    dimensions.
    Alternatively, a custom grid can be used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : AtomArray or AtomArrayStack
        The density is calculated based on these atoms.
    selection : ndarray, dtype=bool, shape=(n,), optional
        Boolean mask for `atoms` to calculate the density only on a set
        of atoms.
    delta : float, optional
        Distance between grid points for density calculation (in Ã…).
    bins : int or sequence of scalars or str, optional
        Bins for the RDF.

        - If `bins` is an `int`, it defines the number of bins.
        - If `bins` is a sequence, it defines the bin edges, ignoring
          the actual coordinates of the `atoms` selection.
        - If `bins` is a string, it defines the function used to
          calculate the bins.

        See `numpy.histogramdd()` for further details.
    density : boolean, optional
        If False, the number of samples in each bin is returned.
        Otherwise, returns the probability density function of each bin.

        See `numpy.histogramdd()` for further details.
    weights: ndarray, shape=(N) or shape=(N,M), optional
        An array of values to weight the contribution of N atoms in 
        models.
        If the shape is (N), the weights will be interpreted as
        *per atom*. A shape of (N,M) allows to additionally weight atoms
        on a per model basis.
    
    Returns
    -------
    H : ndarray, dtype=float
        The threedimensional histogram of the selected atoms.
        The length of the histogram depends on `atoms` coordinates and
        `delta`, or the supplied `bins` input parameter.
    edges : list of ndarray, dtype=float
        A list containing the 3 arrays describing the bin edges.
