Identification of lipid bilayer leaflets
========================================

This script implements the *LeafletFinder* algorithm [1]_ used by
*MDAnalysis*. The algorithm detects which lipid molecules belong to the
same membrane leaflet, i.e. the same side of a lipid bilayer,
irrespective of the shape of the bilayer.

At first the algorithm creates an adjacency matrix of all lipid head
groups, where the cutoff distance is smaller than the minimum distance
between a head group of one leaflet to a head group of another leaflet.
A graph is created from the matrix.
Each leaflet is a connected subgraph.

    Identify which lipids molecules belong to the same lipid bilayer

    Parameters
    ----------
    structure : AtomArray, shape=(n,)
        The structure containing the membrane.
        May also include other molecules, e.g. water or an embedded
        protein.
    head_atom_mask : ndarray, dtype=bool, shape=(n,)
        A boolean mask that selects atoms from `structure` that
        represent lipid head groups.
    cutoff_distance : float, optional
        When the distance of two head groups is larger than this value,
        they are not (directly) connected in the same leaflet.
    periodic : bool, optional,
        If true, periodic boundary conditions are considered.
        This requires that `structure` has an associated `box`.
