Test structures
===============

CYN: Caynide  - Contains negatively charged atom and triple bond
HWB: Cyanidin - Contains positively charged atom
TYR: Tyrosine - common amino acid
03F: Large molecule - More than 100 bonds -> requires 3 characters in CTAB header
13136: More that 8 charges -> requires multiple `M  CHG` rows

The `.v3000.sdf` variants are the same structures but in V3000 format.
They were created with the `create_v3000_sdf.py` script.
