Inofficial Biopython 2 repository
=================================

More information on Biopython can be found on the
`offical website <http://biopython.org/>`_
or on the `offical repository <https://github.com/biopython/biopython>`_.

This repository arose out of an discussion in Biopython's development
`mailing list <http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython-dev/>`_.
The idea was to create a new version of Biopython in order to harmonize naming
and documentation schemes, sort modules and update for modern scientific Python.
This repository is an attempt to implement the ideas for Biopython 2 into actual
code.

Someday the content of this repository might be integrated into an official
Biopython 2 repository.
